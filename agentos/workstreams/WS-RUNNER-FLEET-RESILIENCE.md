key: RUNNER-FLEET-RESILIENCE
title: Runner fleet resilience and physical failure-domain separation
objective: >
  Make PR shipping and authoritative nightly production coexist without one physical
  host becoming a shared failure domain. Done means merge control is off the M2,
  routine full render is off the M2, guarded M1/PC capacity is live and proven, and
  fleet health is visible at physical-host rather than runner-process granularity.

    `parked` is not an exclusion label; positive label matching still routes jobs to
    that listener. See .github/runner-policy.yml.

    A self-hosted runner name is not a physical-host identity; multiple listeners on
    one M2 share CPU, memory, SSD, filesystem and Git I/O. See
    DEC:RUNNER-FLEET-PHYSICAL-FAILURE-DOMAINS.

    The M1 old services died after ENOSPC and included stale identity; never restore

    The generic macstudio label is a broad capability grant, not a capacity label. On
    the 32-GB M1 it is forbidden until a separate current-consumer/resource census proves
    every macstudio job is lawful there. See the M0 adversarial amendment.

    `render-linux` being declared in runner-policy does not prove it is online; the

    Do not buy hardware before restoring and measuring the existing M1/PC fleet; the

    Do not create another runner registry, scheduler, queue, or merge implementation;
    GitHub Actions, .github/runner-policy.yml, the Wave B/C runbook and the existing
    merge controller remain canonical.

    Do not treat PR #6089 as having fixed runner starvation; it fixed Asia-close's
    starvation blindness/classification bug and explicitly left runner starvation
    separate.
  - >
    Do not restore generic macstudio to the M1 merely because mac-builder-1/2 historically
    carried production. Current workload/resource compatibility must be re-proven first.
  - >
    Do not call the hosted canary a merge controller. It has contents:read, no merge token,
    and must never execute scripts/merge_on_green.py; it proves environment capacity only.
next_action: >
  Merge M0 PR #6094. Then land W1-A and obtain three main-ref hosted canary receipts.
  W1-B remains blocked until those receipts pass, including one during the congested
  nightly/render window.

## Current incident

On 2026-08-20 the live `macstudio` pool was starved for about four hours and Asia gate
jobs waited 15-58 minutes for a runner. The primary root is fleet allocation: routine
heavy render and production share the M2, while M1/PC capacity is disconnected or
under-routed and merge-control remains on the same physical M2.

## Authority boundary

This workstream owns fleet topology, host recovery, runner policy, canary substrate, and
render routing. It does **not** own merge semantics. Any edit to
`.github/workflows/merge-on-green.yml` or `scripts/merge_on_green.py` is commissioned
through `WS:CI-MERGE-CONTROL-PLANE`; W1-A supplies environment/capacity proof only and
W1-B is the separately reviewed route cutover.
