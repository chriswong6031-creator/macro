title: CI + merge control-plane recovery (the 2026-08 traffic jam)
objective: >
  A PR loop where ordinary changes validate quickly, structural mistakes red
  in minutes, armed PRs merge without babysitting, and a fast-moving producer
  main cannot re-prove the universe — with no transport in the pipeline that
  an unbounded changed-file list can kill.

  - id: W-TRANSPORT
    title: Bounded changed-files transport (E2BIG repair, PR 5578 incident)
    status: awaiting_ci
    note: >
      Landed directly on main's architecture after both rewrite lineages
      churned: the list rides the ci-changed-files artifact, its sha256 joins
      plan_hash_payload so --expect-plan-sha pins it, children read
      CI_CHANGED_FILES_FILE, and the CI_CHANGED_FILES_JSON env/output hops are
      deleted. Evidence: DSC:CI-CHANGED-FILES-ENV-HAS-AN-EXECVE-CEILING;
      E2BIG execve mutation regression in tests/test_ci_pack.py; wiring pins
      in tests/test_ci_plan_workflow.py.
  - id: W-REWRITE
    title: Structural rewrite of planner/merge control plane
    status: in_progress
    note: >
      Two lineages collided 2026-08-14: PR 5585 (claude — API diff, plan
      consumption, wake diet) was closed in a reconciliation naming PR 5591
      (codex — authority plan artifact, committed scope index, evidence
      chain) canonical. PR 5591 was closed unmerged on 2026-08-15 and is now
      historical archaeology only; it carried the E2BIG defects this
      workstream's W-TRANSPORT fixed on main. Any successor must preserve the
      bounded transport — the wiring pins enforce it.
  - id: W-SEMANTIC-PROOF
    title: Semantic CI proof identity and ancestry-valid healing
    status: done
    note: >
      CEO V2 semantic proof landed through PR 5750 as
      064ebd53a9de3cd0fcc3eb813e634f30106eed03 on 2026-08-15. Current main
      b2938ee302e16654de2858e820877cad096f2446 is a verified descendant. Main
      semantic-producer run 31890203055 on descendant
      719b13774da34e518da57591f2cf940cbe9c856c emitted
      ci.semantic_evidence.v1 with status=clear for 194 jobs and no
      infrastructure findings; merge-on-green consumer run 31892639093 then
      completed successfully on that same merged head. Downstream merged-head
      consumer fixes PR 5756 / 0e84abd736d0 and PR 5757 / 5c253e21b4f7 also
      passed their exact-head semantic CI runs 31894942765 and 31896763803.
      Execution packs remain transport only; shared semantic identity,
      exact-base causality, complete accounting, infrastructure refusal,
      ancestry-valid monotone healing, authority self-excuse refusal, and
      ProofFreshness remain the governing contract. PR 5591 remains historical
      W-REWRITE archaeology only; completing this wave does not commission or
      complete W-REWRITE or any CI-speed/scoping wave.
  - id: W-GATE-SPLIT
    title: Merge gate tests code against fixtures; data receipts post-nightly
    status: in_progress
    note: >
      Root cause DSC:MERGE-GATE-IS-GATED-ON-MOVING-DATA (main green 44%
      because 130-by-heuristic / 74-by-judgment of 194 merge-gate jobs assert
      on the nightly-rewritten tree). W1 merged 2026-08-19 as PR 5954: every
      legacy job declares gate: code | data (120/74; judgment pass over every
      named suite; decisive discriminator = git authorship of the asserted
      file). W2 MERGED 2026-08-19 10:58Z as PR 5969: ci.yml plans/packs --gate code everywhere
      (baselines prove exactly what the gate runs; the planner fallback is
      gated too), gate: data jobs run in .github/workflows/data-health.yml
      after a SUCCESSFUL nightly, failure feeds one standing data-health
      issue; W4 reachability + no-empty-pack guards ship with it. Opus
      pre-PR review fixed 2 blockers + 4 majors in the lane (repo resolution,
      label ensure, needs-result-not-artifact-presence, literal concurrency
      group, nightly-conclusion gate, fail-closed lookup).

The E2BIG incident model and receipts live in
DSC:CI-CHANGED-FILES-ENV-HAS-AN-EXECVE-CEILING and the session handoff
CI-MERGE-CONTROL-PLANE-2026-08-14-e2big.md. The competing rewrite lineages'
own documentation lives in their PRs (5585 and 5591 both closed unmerged).
The mandatory pre-build semantic-step census is committed as
`DSC-CI-SEMANTIC-PROOF-MANIFEST-CENSUS.v1.json`.

## W-SEMANTIC-PROOF engineering receipts

- The pinned pre-build census records 193 logical jobs, 614 semantic steps,
  185 dependency-install steps, zero unnamed executable steps, and one
  two-step duplicate-name group. Only those two SBIR/STTR steps received
  explicit `proof_id` values. After fresh-main reconciliation the validated
  manifest has 194 logical jobs and 623 semantic units; no new ambiguity was
  introduced.
- `ci.pack_plan.v2` binds workflow/run/event role, tested merge tree, subject
  head, exact base, changed-file digest, semantic inventory, execution digests,
  and transport partition. `ci.semantic_fragment.v1` carries raw bounded pack
  observations. `ci.semantic_evidence.v1` is written once by `ci-gate`, including
  on planner failure, and is the only semantic-era causality verdict.
- Exact-base replay creates one independently pinned checkout, uses the base
  checkout's runner and manifest, and runs at most one serial child per failed
  logical job under one 900-second deadline. It does not create a replay matrix.
- The hostile mutation battery killed 14/14 required mutations. It exposed and
  closed a real missing-ancestry regression fixture before reaching zero
  survivors. Fresh review also closed main infrastructure bypass, job-level
  infrastructure healing, inactive pilot-authority context handling, and a
  production Unicode plan-digest mismatch.
- Local performance at the pre-release carrier: semantic inventory median
  6.316 ms (p95 9.010 ms), full plan median 9.233 ms, bounded failure capture
  over 1,001 representative lines median 0.444 ms (p95 0.702 ms), and full
  194-job/622-unit reconciliation median 12.106 ms (p95 18.490 ms). Exact-base
  checkout became ready in 129.346 s and checkout plus bounded cleanup took
  160.354 s, inside the shared 900-second red-only budget. These are overhead
  measurements, not a claim that the CI suite itself is faster.
- Green consumer paths make zero semantic artifact calls. A linked red PR lookup
  is bounded to three JSON calls plus one artifact download; descendant history
  is capped at 12 candidates. Main semantic dispatch is exact-SHA-bound and costs
  at most three calls when a red breaker lacks current evidence.
- Bootstrap remains deliberately unresolved in this file: this authority-changing
  branch must earn the old required checks without using its new inherited-red
  reasoning. Status stays `in_progress` until merged-main verification.
