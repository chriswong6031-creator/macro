title: Mastermind Agent OS — organizational knowledge and work-identity plane
objective: >
  Give the organization a durable record of what work exists, why things were decided,
  what was learned, and what is next — without building a third control plane. Done =
  workstreams, decisions, discoveries, and handoffs are written by live sessions, and
  the CEO reads one generated page instead of reconstructing state by hand.

  Finish W2B's cross-repo readiness E2E and CI. Keep the brief list-free and the
  readiness envelope graph-only; Mastermind's improvement agenda remains the sole
  ranked queue. W4 remains todo until W2B is proven and the separate hook wave begins.

## Context

The commissioning brief describes a missing coordination layer. Reconnaissance found the
coordination layer exists twice — the Macro fleet law governing Claude Code sessions, and the
Mastermind Executive OS governing Codex worker processes (Phase 1C-A as of 2026-08-12 03:53).
What is genuinely missing is the knowledge plane: positive decision records, cross-account
discoveries, a handoff schema, work identity between "program" and "PR", and a CEO rollup.

## Scope boundary

This workstream owns the knowledge plane only. It does not touch either execution plane, and
invariant I1 makes that structural rather than promised: nothing here can block or start work.

## Phase 1 acceptance receipts

The current store contains twelve independent real-work handoff records across seven
non-Agent-OS workstreams. None came from the Agent OS scaffolding/compiler sessions or this
Phase 2b closure session, and every implementation commit is merged to `origin/main`:

- `agentos/handoffs/CI-MERGE-CONTROL-PLANE-2026-08-14-e2big.md`
- `agentos/handoffs/CI-MERGE-CONTROL-PLANE-2026-08-14-exclusive-curation.md`
- `agentos/handoffs/LIVE-ENTRY-RADAR-2026-08-13.md`
- `agentos/handoffs/LIVE-ENTRY-RADAR-2026-08-14.md`
- `agentos/handoffs/PROPHET-CONDITIONAL-FUSION-2026-08-14.md`
- `agentos/handoffs/PROPHET-CONDITIONAL-FUSION-2026-08-14-pr1a.md`
- `agentos/handoffs/PROPHET-US-AVAILABILITY-2026-08-14.md`
- `agentos/handoffs/STOCK-IDENTITY-2026-08-13.md`
- `agentos/handoffs/STOCK-IDENTITY-2026-08-14.md`
- `agentos/handoffs/WS-EVAL-OS-MEASUREMENT-LAW-2026-08-14.md`
- `agentos/handoffs/WS-EVAL-OS-MEASUREMENT-LAW-2026-08-14-P0D.md`
- `agentos/handoffs/WS-EVAL-OS-T1-ENGINE-REGISTRY-2026-08-14.md`

Multiple workstreams authored more than one genuine implementation handoff, so record count
and distinct-workstream count intentionally differ. The two `WS:AGENT-OS` handoffs are
excluded. These are adoption receipts, not manufactured closure records. W3 separately closed
when PR #5561 merged; W2B stays `awaiting_ci` until its Macro producer and Mastermind consumer
pass the deployed cross-repo E2E.

## Phase 2b mapping acceptance

The current Improvement Agenda sources do not author Agent OS workstream/wave identities.
Phase 2b therefore accepts zero production mappings as the only honest initial state: every
real item is N/A until its own source explicitly supplies `agentos_ref`. The E2E must still
prove that Mastermind reads and indexes the real producer, that a synthetic exact tuple joins,
and that title or evidence prose never manufactures a mapping. A future source that gains a
legitimate stable identity may opt in at construction time without changing ranking policy.
