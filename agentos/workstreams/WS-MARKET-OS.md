objective: >
  Turn the free stock dashboard, per-security dossiers, Portfolio, and named Watchlists
  into one coherent investing operating system. Done means a user can discover what
  changed, understand one security, track actual holdings and attention sets without
  population drift, receive source-grounded personal impact, and return through useful
  change monitoring across Macro and Terminal.

landmines:
  - >-
    FIXED by A1A (#6098): `templates/market_books.js::buildModel` no longer unions
    Watchlist symbols into Portfolio books and the pinning tests were replaced.
    Do not restore the union; population law is §11 of the A1A freeze.
  - >-
    `templates/watchlist.js::runEntry` currently mutates the Watchlist and a temporary
    ENTERED overlay; it is not a canonical Portfolio import.
  - >-
    FIXED by A1A closure (#6136): identity decides authority (_isLocalMode := !user);
    an authenticated cloud failure resolves degraded/error (last-good read-only or
    explicit unavailability), never the local book, and failed Portfolio writes say
    "Change not saved" — never the Watchlist's "changes kept locally" claim. There is
    still NO authenticated offline outbox; do not claim retention on write failure.
  - >-
    The Active Build Map is generated/advisory and can be stale relative to current
    main; regenerate and inspect live worktrees before every runtime dispatch.
  - >-
    Terminal PR #429 changes large-Portfolio quote demand; Terminal consumer work must
    re-census its disposition before editing PortfolioView or quote-demand paths.
do_not_redo:
  - Do not create another Portfolio, Watchlist, event, identity, risk, or brief store.
  - Do not merge Watchlist attention membership into Portfolio ownership semantics.
  - Do not call a temporary pasted basket a saved Portfolio.
  - Do not restore the old single-table persistence recommendation from WS:WATCHLIST-PORTFOLIO-CEO.
  - Do not invent a cluster by calling the largest half of the book a hidden bet.
  - Do not silently complete mixed sizing or mixed current/cost price bases.
  - Do not let LLM output originate a signal, rank, gate, size, forecast probability, or trade decision.
  - Do not treat the six-tab Risk Center or giant inline drawers as the final flagship design.
  - Do not call infrastructure or green CI product completion without a real production user journey.

  A1A engineering is merged and live (#6136, 2633380f800a) with the anonymous
  production matrix passed; the authenticated matrix + Terminal conformance + privacy
  inspection await an operator-supplied authenticated vehicle, then Sol's acceptance.
  A1B and every later wave remain blocked on Sol accepting A1A in production.

## Current state

The product thesis and experience/intelligence architecture are frozen. The first six
planning turns established one product with three lenses: Market, Security, and My
Market; one shared Decision Spine; separate public intelligence and private exposure;
and explicit fact, deterministic-state, forecast, and decision authority.

The current Portfolio implementation is not a safe foundation for import or advanced
analysis because it can describe the Watchlist, a temporary basket, or canonical
positions through the same surface. A1A repairs that authority before adding a writer.

## Program-parent note

This workstream cites `terminal-user-services` because the existing semantic registry
owns the shared user-state and alert product boundary. Market OS does not transfer
identity, news, company-event, signal, risk, or forecast authority into that program;
those domain owners remain independent and are composed through governed contracts.
A later semantic-map amendment may introduce a dedicated flagship product program, but
that registry change is not required to begin the bounded A1A truth repair.
