key: EARNINGS-EVENT-INTELLIGENCE-COMPILER
title: Earnings Event Intelligence Compiler — E3 arc
objective: >
  Build one clock-safe Event Intelligence Compiler in which models propose
  candidates, deterministic validation admits evidence, and accepted
  intelligence extends the existing canonical event_workspace.v1. Done means
  E3-A gold+leakage-free eval, E3-B non-empty live AAPL Q&A in Terminal,
  E3-C non-empty second-issuer Q&A in product, and E3-P natural-cycle
  accepted exchange on an eligible print. No earnings_qual score as event
  truth and no FIF/Prophet fork.

  PR #6245. Topic consensus is UNRESOLVED / PASS_A_REFERENCE_ONLY.

  After #6245 lands, mark E3-A done as a completed calibration /
  negative-method experiment. Do not start E3-A2 or E3-B before it lands.

landmines:
  - WS:EARNINGS-INTELLIGENCE-OS is done; do not reopen E2-T1 or E2-D to make E3 look active.
  - Parent event_workspace.v1 WORKSPACE_KEYS are closed; a new top-level key is a schema bump Terminal exactKeys will fail.
  - Macro nested sources[] are list-only (silent pass); Terminal nested sources are strip; that is not additive compatibility.
  - DNR:KILL-LLM-ORIGINATION and DNR:KILL-LLM-FRAME-TAGS — no deflection/evasiveness/non-answer verdicts in E3.
  - FIF remains financial-fact authority; FIF-7 still owns earnings/non-GAAP/KPI/guidance convergence; basis_match true and beat/miss stay forbidden.
  - Local Qwen _call_openai_compat currently writes no ai_costs row; E3 must ledger it.
  - earnings_qual head/tail truncation is not canonical extraction.
  - identity_not_in_source is not a valid TypedAbsence reason; use speaker_unresolvable.
  - N=7 AAPL gold is calibration, not OOS; do not auto-unlock E3-B without a pre-frozen or Sol-granted usefulness gate.
do_not_redo:
  - Do not reopen the ratified E3-0 freeze (#6161 / 22686d255eb047cf5bffc91a35984515acb3d466).
  - Do not implement runtime E3 in the architecture wave.
  - Do not treat earnings_qual output as event truth.
  - Do not create a second Q&A store beside qa_exchanges.
  - Do not create a second model-routing control plane.
  - Do not create a durable candidate database or R2 plane in E3-A or E3-B.
  - Do not freeze GOOGL (or CAT/BAC/SNOW) as the E3-C issuer before a held source-completeness receipt.
  - Do not invent or loosen Q&A usefulness thresholds after seeing model results.
  - Do not stamp generated_at or conference time as transcript source_available_at.
  - Do not mint a second earnings-intelligence program key.
  - Do not record this architecture decision as decided_by coo-fable.
  - Do not tune Qwen's full-transcript prompt to rescue a measured [] result.
  - Do not collapse qa_exchange.v1 respondents[] to unique speakers.
  - Do not treat a validator rejection as an accepted-object hard-gate miss.
  - Do not rewrite AAPL historical gold when a later current-marker generation moves if source SHAs still match.
  - Do not rewrite the pre-inference blind Pass B packet after inference.
  - Do not treat blind-packet hash b2ae2508… as the qa_topic.v1 taxonomy hash.
  - Do not treat Haiku topic Jaccard as usefulness, promotion, or topic-model authority.
  - Do not start E3-A2 or E3-B before #6245 lands.

E3-0 landed on main at `22686d255eb047cf5bffc91a35984515acb3d466` (#6161; Sol review 5000425939). E0–E2 stay closed on `WS:EARNINGS-INTELLIGENCE-OS`. Canonical freeze: `research/earnings_intelligence/e3/E3_EVENT_INTELLIGENCE_COMPILER_FREEZE_2026-08-20.md`. Owner is `coo-fable` (execution). Architecture authority is `DEC:E3-EVENT-INTELLIGENCE-COMPILER-NOT-SCORER` `decided_by: sol`.

E3-A R2 (2026-08-23) is the final landing repair on PR #6245. Gold is `aapl_fy2026_q3_qa_gold.v2` SHA `fc6df84d2a8d0d96475ce697ba92ffdd071d5c283b8daee97c1b3381382fa42c`; v1 `6b1100b148396db9a29974da5bc6e0cc55e5534185e50e061fe3635d429ed761` is superseded calibration gold. Canonical taxonomy remains `qa_topic.v1` / `a928ca72ab2e91bda74bd1e69021e08a5234e501f095610e623655db7e323b5e`. The immutable blind Pass B packet stores `b2ae2508877ccda4dea911d52952c49f78b0dbc26049326d542ee77439cf9a14` as a **noncanonical pass-local members digest**, not the qa_topic.v1 hash; enum membership matches. **Topic adjudication is UNRESOLVED / PASS_A_REFERENCE_ONLY** — Pass A and Pass B disagree on all 7 per-exchange topic sets; Haiku Jaccard 0.722 is descriptive against Pass-A reference labels only and grants zero topic-model authority. Structural adjudication is accepted: 7 Operator-delimited exchanges, exact source spans, identities, 26 management answer-turns. Measured eval `run_id=27e3e380f70658c1` on git head `154ec6204e585c70a576a7cf249acc2b394aa69c` is unchanged: Qwen `[]` (NOT_EXERCISED, local $0.00); Haiku benchmark-only. Sol review 5001579080. After #6245 lands, E3-A may be recorded done as a completed calibration / negative-method experiment. **E3-B stays locked. Do not start E3-A2 before #6245 lands. Return the exact final head to Sol.**
